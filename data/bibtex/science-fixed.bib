abstract = "Resumen Se analizan los beneficios que aporta el empleo de la metodología Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) cuando se utiliza como base y soporte de entornos de diseño de sistemas de tiempo real. Con esta metodología, se incrementa la facilidad de uso del entorno para el diseñador, ya que, en función del paradigma que utilice y de la fase del proceso de diseño que esté llevando a cabo, el entorno le ofrece una vista especializada del sistema, la cual presenta de una forma precisa y coherente la información sobre la que está decidiendo. Por otro lado, una infraestructura \{MDE\} facilita el desarrollo de herramientas y su integración en el entorno, ya que, a través de los mecanismos de gestión y transformación de modelos con los que está dotada, cada herramienta recibe únicamente la información que utiliza, estructurada de modo adecuado, y así mismo, puede generar sus resultados de la forma que le sea natural, ya que el entorno los sabe gestionar. Por último, la metodología \{MDE\} permite considerar el entorno de diseño de tiempo real como una vista especializada que se integra coherentemente en un entorno más general, el cual soporta las restantes fases del diseño del sistema. This paper analyses the benefits provided by the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology when it is used as the base support for real-time systems design environments. The application of \{MDE\} eases the environment usage by the designer, because depending on the chosen paradigm and on the stage of the development process, the environment offers a specialized view of the system, presenting in a precise and coherent fashion the information under decision. On the other hand, an \{MDE\} infrastructure facilitates the development of tools and their integration within the environment, as, through the model management and transformation mechanisms this infrastructure is equipped with, every tool receives as input the right information it uses, structured as it needs, and likewise, each tool can generate its results in its natural format, relying in that the environment is able to manage them. Finally, the \{MDE\} methodology allows considering the real-time design environment as a specialized view meant to be integrated in a more general framework that encompasses the remaining system design stages.

abstract = "Metadata are a key element for the development of information infrastructures because they facilitate the semantic description of contents and services. However, the diversity and heterogeneity of metadata standards have become a barrier for the generation of these metadata. Many metadata editors are not useful anymore because they do not support the latest version of metadata standards or the new profiles arisen in the market. Thus, this work proposes a model driven approach for the development of metadata editors, more focused on the generic treatment of metadata models than on the development of specific edition forms for a reduced set of metadata standards. This approach has been tested in the context of Spatial Data Infrastructures for the development of an Open Source tool called CatMDEdit. Additionally, the approach could be also applied to improve the efficiency of any metadata editor using a metamodeling development strategy. ",

The hyper-linked structure of the web creates a dynamic relationship between context and content, making it difficult to get a complete picture of the conceptual mapping of the information. It can be difficult for a human reader to extract usable meaning. This human-understandable semantics can be achieved only when the conceptual structure of the content becomes an essential part of the posted material. Research studies have proved that UML-based ontologies can bring semantic coherence; their visual modeling can facilitate conceptual browsing and would be understandable to both machine and users.

abstract = "Software product lines (SPLs) are used in industry to develop families of similar software systems. Legacy systems, either highly configurable or with a story of versions and local variations, are potential candidates for reconfiguration as \{SPLs\} using reengineering techniques. Existing \{SPLs\} can also be restructured using specific refactorings to improve their internal quality. Although many contributions (including industrial experiences) can be found in the literature, we lack a global vision covering the whole life cycle of an evolving product line. This study aims to survey existing research on the reengineering of legacy systems into \{SPLs\} and the refactoring of existing \{SPLs\} in order to identify proven approaches and pending challenges for future research in both subfields. We launched a systematic mapping study to find as much literature as possible, covering the diverse terms involved in the search string (restructuring, refactoring, reengineering, etc. always connected with SPLs) and filtering the papers using relevance criteria. The 74 papers selected were classified with respect to several dimensions: main focus, research and contribution type, academic or industrial validation if included, etc. We classified the research approaches and analyzed their feasibility for use in industry. The results of the study indicate that the initial works focused on the adaptation of generic reengineering processes to \{SPL\} extraction. Starting from that foundation, several trends have been detected in recent research: the integrated or guided reengineering of (typically object-oriented) legacy code and requirements; specific aspect-oriented or feature-oriented refactoring into SPLs, and more recently, refactoring for the evolution of existing product lines. A majority of papers include academic or industrial case studies, though only a few are based on quantitative data. The degree of maturity of both subfields is different: Industry examples for the reengineering of the legacy system subfield are abundant, although more evaluation research is needed to provide better evidence for adoption in industry. Product line evolution through refactoring is an emerging topic with some pending challenges. Although it has recently received some attention, the theoretical foundation is rather limited in this subfield and should be addressed in the near future. To sum up, the main contributions of this work are the classification of research approaches as well as the analysis of remaining challenges, open issues, and research opportunities. ",

abstract = "Abstract Capturing physical data in the context of measurement systems is a demanding process that often requires many repetitions with different settings. To assist in this activity, a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) called Sequencer has been developed to enable the improved definition of measurement procedures. With Sequencer, the level of abstraction has been raised and sophisticated changes in measurement procedures are now enabled. Although there are numerous \{DSMLs\} like Sequencer in the existing literature, there are some obstacles working against the more widespread adoption of \{DSMLs\} in practice. One challenge is the lack of supporting tools for DSMLs, which would improve the capabilities of end-users of such languages. For instance, support for debugging a model expressed in a \{DSML\} is often neglected. The lack of a debugger at the proper abstraction level limits the domain experts in discovering and locating bugs in a model. In this paper, Sequencer is presented together with debugging facilities (called Ladybird) that are integrated in a modeling environment. Ladybird supports different execution modes (e.g., steps, breakpoints, animations, variable views, and stack traces) that can be helpful during the debugging of a model. Ladybird's primary contribution is in showing the value of error detection in complicated industrial environments, such as data acquisition in automotive testing. The paper contributes to a discussion of the implementation details of \{DSML\} debugging facilities and how such a debugger can be reused to support domains other than the measurement context of Sequencer.

It is clear that new project techniques are demanded to support the design of such systems. At design phase, it is extremely important to raise abstraction level in earlier stages of product development in order to deal with such a complexity in an efficient way. This paper discusses Model Driven Engineering (MDE) applied to design industrial mechatronics systems. An aspect-oriented \{MDE\} approach is presented by means of a real-world case study, comprising requirements engineering up to code generation. An assessment of two well-known high-level paradigms, namely Aspect- and Object-Oriented paradigms, is deeply presented. Their concepts are applied at every design step of an embedded and real-time mechatronics system, specifically for controlling a product assembler industrial cell. The handling of functional and non-functional requirements (at modeling level) using aspects and objects is further emphasized. Both designs are compared using a set of software engineering metrics, which were adapted to be applied at modeling level. Particularly, the achieved results show the suitability of each paradigm for the system specification in terms of reusability quality of model elements. Focused on the generated code for each case study, statistics depicted an improvement in number of lines using aspects. ",

We study relations between viewpoints at the levels of people, models and tools, and present solutions that are used to formally and explicitly capture such relations. Viewpoint contracts are used to define the vocabulary, assumptions and constraints required for ensuring smooth communication between stakeholders (people level). Dependency models capture relations between product properties belonging to different viewpoints, and how such dependencies relate to predictions and decisions (model level). Tool integration models describe the relations between tools in terms of traceability, data exchange, invocation and notifications (tool level). A major contribution of this paper is a unification approach, elaborating how these solutions can be used synergetically to integrate viewpoints. An industrial robot case study is utilized to illustrate the challenges and solutions with respect to relations between viewpoints, including the unification approach. ",

A multi-controller architecture has been proposed in the literature for coping with different dynamics. It is composed by as many control algorithms as operation modes and a supervisor that tracks the system’s operation, switching to the appropriate control algorithm when a new operation mode is reached. This paper explores the advantages of model-based techniques to automate the implementation of the supervisor and its integration into the final real-time control system from the simulation dynamic model. In particular, the Model Driven Engineering approach has been followed in order to provide a framework to support the development cycle of the control system for mode switched processes. It uses information from the model of the process and from the control loops designed and using model transformation techniques the supervisor is automatically generated. In order to provide independency from the particular simulation tools used for defining the process model, meta-models are proposed for both, the process and the supervisor, as well as for the necessary transformations. A proof of concept framework has been designed for the target field of automation applications, generating the supervisor in \{PLCopen\} \{XML\} format for achieving vendor independency. ",

abstract = "Feature Diagrams (FDs) are a family of popular modelling languages used to address the feature interaction problem, particularly in software product lines, \{FDs\} were first introduced by Kang as part of the \{FODA\} (Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis) method back in 1990. Afterwards, various extensions of \{FODA\} \{FDs\} were introduced to compensate for a purported ambiguity and lack of precision and expressiveness. However, they never received a formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity and a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation. The reported work is intended to contribute a more rigorous approach to the definition, understanding, evaluation, selection and implementation of \{FD\} languages. First, we provide a survey of \{FD\} variants. Then, we give them a formal semantics, thanks to a generic construction that we call Free Feature Diagrams (FFDs). This demonstrates that \{FDs\} can be precise and unambiguous. This also defines their expressiveness. Many variants are expressively complete, and thus the endless quest for extensions actually cannot be justified by expressiveness. A finer notion is thus needed to compare these expressively complete languages. Two solutions are well-established: succinctness and embeddability, that express the naturalness of a language. We show that the expressively complete \{FDs\} fall into two succinctness classes, of which we of course recommend the most succinct. Among the succinct expressively complete languages, we suggest a new, simple one that is not harmfully redundant: Varied \{FD\} (VFD). Finally, we study the execution time that tools will need to solve useful problems in these languages. ",

Objective The goal of this article is to develop a framework for specifying and automatically extracting design aspects relevant to safety requirements. This goal is realized through the combination of two components: (1) A methodology for establishing traceability between safety requirements and design, and (2) an algorithm that can extract for any given safety requirement a minimized fragment (slice) of the design that is sound, and yet easy to understand and inspect. Method We ground our framework on System Modeling Language (SysML). The framework includes a traceability information model, a methodology to establish traceability, and mechanisms for model slicing based on the recorded traceability information. The framework is implemented in a tool, named SafeSlice. Results We prove that our slicing algorithm is sound for temporal safety properties, and argue about the completeness of slices based on our practical experience. We report on the lessons learned from applying our approach to two case studies, one benchmark and one industrial case. Both studies indicate that our approach substantially reduces the amount of information that needs to be inspected for ensuring that a given (behavioral) safety requirement is met by the design. ",

@article{Nair2014689,
abstract = "AbstractContext Critical systems in domains such as aviation, railway, and automotive are often subject to a formal process of safety certification. The goal of this process is to ensure that these systems will operate safely without posing undue risks to the user, the public, or the environment. Safety is typically ensured via complying with safety standards. Demonstrating compliance to these standards involves providing evidence to show that the safety criteria of the standards are met. Objective In order to cope with the complexity of large critical systems and subsequently the plethora of evidence information required for achieving compliance, safety professionals need in-depth knowledge to assist them in classifying different types of evidence, and in structuring and assessing the evidence. This paper is a step towards developing such a body of knowledge that is derived from a large-scale empirically rigorous literature review. Method We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the basis for our work. The \{SLR\} builds on 218 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, from 4963 studies published between 1990 and 2012. Results We develop a taxonomy that classifies the information and artefacts considered as evidence for safety. We review the existing techniques for safety evidence structuring and assessment, and further study the relevant challenges that have been the target of investigation in the academic literature. We analyse commonalities in the results among different application domains and discuss implications of the results for both research and practice. Conclusion The paper is, to our knowledge, the largest existing study on the topic of safety evidence. The results are particularly relevant to practitioners seeking a better grasp on evidence requirements as well as to researchers in the area of system safety. As a major finding of the review, the results strongly suggest the need for more practitioner-oriented and industry-driven empirical studies in the area of safety certification. ",

The aim of the \{PRACE\} EU-project is to bring a mobile dual arm service robot into small part assembly tasks, which should be used by regular workers. To fulfill this goal a model driven engineering (MDE) tool chain was developed that separates three different user roles in the development process of an industrial service robot application. For each of these roles, the spectrum of required knowledge is reduced, especially for the role of the end user. Based on the implementation of this separation, an evaluation during the development of the \{PRACE\} demonstration use case was done. ",

abstract = "Model-driven engineering (MDE), implicitly based upon meta-model principles, is gaining more and more attention in software systems due to its inherent benefits. Its use normally improves the quality of the developed systems in terms of productivity, portability, inter-operability and maintenance. Therefore, its exploitation for the development of multi-agent systems (MAS) emerges in a natural way. In this paper, agent-oriented software development (AOSD) and \{MDE\} paradigms are fully integrated for the development of MAS. Meta-modeling techniques are explicitly used to speed up several phases of the process. The Prometheus methodology is used for the purpose of validating the proposal. The meta-object facility (MOF) architecture is used as a guideline for developing a \{MAS\} editor according to the language provided by Prometheus methodology. Firstly, an Ecore meta-model for Prometheus language is developed. Ecore is a powerful tool for designing model-driven architectures (MDA). Next, facilities provided by the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) are used to generate the graphical editor. It offers support to develop agent models conform to the meta-model specified. Afterwards, it is also described how an agent code generator can be developed. In this way, code is automatically generated using as input the model specified with the graphical editor. A case of study validates the method put in practice for the development of a multi-agent surveillance system. ",

abstract = "Abstract Research into software design models in general, and into the \{UML\} in particular, focuses on answering the question how design models are used, completely ignoring the question if they are used. There is an assumption in the literature that the \{UML\} is the de facto standard, and that use of design models has had a profound and substantial effect on how software is designed by virtue of models giving the ability to do model-checking, code generation, or automated test generation. However for this assumption to be true, there has to be significant use of design models in practice by developers. This paper presents the results of a survey summarizing the answers of 3785 developers answering the simple question on the extent to which design models are used before coding. We relate their use of models with (i) total years of programming experience, (ii) open or closed development, (iii) educational level, (iv) programming language used, and (v) development type. The answer to our question was that design models are not used very extensively in industry, and where they are used, the use is informal and without tool support, and the notation is often not UML. The use of models decreased with an increase in experience and increased with higher level of qualification. Overall we found that models are used primarily as a communication and collaboration mechanism where there is a need to solve problems and/or get a joint understanding of the overall design in a group. We also conclude that models are seldom updated after initially created and are usually drawn on a whiteboard or on paper. ",
